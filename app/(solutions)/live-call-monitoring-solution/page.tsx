              control solution. It can help in streamlining the quality
              assurance policies in call centers and similar industry verticals

              acknowledgment of agents. In fact, the quality assurance manager
              can jump into the call and take control of the call to lead it in
              the right direction. Whether it is handling a multifaceted support
              request or a warm lead, there is always control in the hands of
              supervisors to lead a customer in a favorable situation.
